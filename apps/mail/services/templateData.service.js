  `Now is the winter of our discontent
  Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
  And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
  In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
  Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
  Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
  Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
  Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
  Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
  And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
  To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
  He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
  To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
  But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
  Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
  I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
  To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
  I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,`,

  `After Binance walked away from the FTX deel, leaked messages to WSJ shows SBF asking for up to $8 billion from investors given inability to fund withdrawals.

  Meanwhile, FTX is facing a regulatory probe over its handling of client funds and lending practices, according to Bloomberg.
  
  Binance signed a nonbinding letter of intent to buy FTX's non-U.S. operations on Tuesday, in an effort to solve FTX's liquidity crunch. Cryptocurrency prices tumbled over concerns of FTX's financial health and potential insolvency of the fourth largest crypto exchange.`,

  This section assumes knowledge of Components. Feel free to skip it and come back later.
  
  When you use the class attribute on a component with a single root element, those classes will be added to the component's root element, and merged with any existing class already on it.

  `The goal was to be able to create custom style sheets and allow for the coloring of icons for Creating a Dovetail Agent Theme.

  For this code to work well the starting color needs to be black. If your icon set isn't black you can prepend "brightness(0) saturate(100%)" to your filter property which will first turn the icon set to black.
  
  For as long as I worked on creating this solution from multiple resources I found some had spent far longer to create this already completed solution. Only slightly modified to focus on HEX colors. Credit goes to MultiplyByZer0 for their post https://stackoverflow.com/a/43960991/604861`,

  `A text line shuffler can be useful if you're doing cross-browser testing. For example, if you're testing forms that needs unique content, then you can randomize a string list and paste it in the forms. As the order of shuffled lines is unpredictable, each form will have unique text in them. Similarly, if you need to write a browser test or an algorithm that checks for duplicate content, then you can shuffle lines, and then feed it to the algorithm. As the lines were shuffled, the data is the same and only the order is different. Another use case is simply shuffling data and picking random items from data. Once you shuffle a string list, you can take the top elements and the result will be exactly the same as picking random items from the list.`,
